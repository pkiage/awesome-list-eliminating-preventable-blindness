- **Safe** – avoiding harm to people for whom the care is intended; and
- **People-centred** – providing care that responds to individual preferences, needs and values.
- **Timely** – reducing waiting times and sometimes harmful delays;
- **Equitable** – providing care that does not vary in quality on account of gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socio-economic status;
- **Integrated** – providing care that makes available the full range of health services throughout the life course;
- **Efficient** – maximizing the benefit of available resources and avoiding waste.
